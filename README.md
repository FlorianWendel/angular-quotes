# AngularQuotes

This is just a little demo to get used with the Angular bindings for [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) ([ng2-redux](https://github.com/angular-redux/ng2-redux)).

This version uses [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) to ensure immutability (unchangeable object) for the store.
See the [branch seamless-immutable](https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-quotes/tree/seamless-immutable) for an alternative implementation.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
